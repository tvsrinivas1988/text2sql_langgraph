    "In SAP S/4HANA, the Cost Element Hierarchy defines the types of expenses and revenues (e.g., salaries, rent, advertising, sales income) and links financial accounts with controlling objects. Cost Centers represent organizational units such as departments or functions where costs are incurred, and each cost center is assigned to a Functional Area that groups similar activities (like production, sales, or administration) for reporting in Profit & Loss statements. Profit Centers represent business units responsible for profitability and are often associated with brands, divisions, or regions. Sales performance is captured in the Sales Data table, which records key figures (sales, margin), versions (plan, actual, forecast), time periods, and the related profit center. The Income and Expense Reporting table consolidates financial performance by linking cost elements, cost centers, functional areas, and profit centers, providing detailed insights into revenues, costs, and profitability across dimensions.\n",

    "\n",

    "Cost Centers → Functional Areas: Each cost center belongs to one functional area for P&L grouping.\n",
    "Profit Centers can aggregate multiple cost centers and capture sales and expense values.\n",
    "Sales Data → Profit Centers: Sales metrics are assigned to profit centers for profitability analysis.\n",
    "Income & Expense Reporting brings all together, linking Functional Area, Profit Center, Cost Center, and Cost Element with values, forming the central reporting layer.\n",
